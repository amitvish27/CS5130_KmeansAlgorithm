Vegetable Hibachi- So flavor filled! And the rice was cooked to perfection!

Miso Soup- It wasn't overpowering and had a very refreshing taste, it's my top comfort food!

Spicy Shrimp Roll- It was good, but i'm not a fan of spicy mayo. Not my favorite thing to eat, but it was still good.

Shrimp Tempura Roll- It's so hard to get good sushi lately, but this roll nailed it! The shrimp tempura was hot while the Avocado and cucumbers were nice and cool! So satisfying to eat!
